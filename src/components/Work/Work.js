                of our ninjas. With a 3,000 supply, the community and respective
                DAO will be very exclusive.

                  Hidden Warriors came into existence in an effort to fight for
                  Peace on the TRON Blockchain. These ninjas represent the speed
                  and agility found on TRON. They represent unity and hope, in
                  which the TRON community members remain loyal to. Hidden
                  Warriors brings the aspect of nostalgia, 8-bit memories into a
                  2021-bit future. The existence of this reality at present, is
                  a reminder of what this space has evolved from – and where we
                  are heading. Paying homage to TRON and the legacy at large is
                  what we aim to accomplish with this project set forth.

                  activations that are only accessible through this membership
                  Warrior memberships will be tiered, based on the number of
                  warriors you hold in your wallet.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Tier 1 – 1 Ninja: standard membership that grants you access
                  to random TRX airdrops and new species airdrops
                  <br />

                  As the TRON marketplace evolves and we begin to position
                  ourselves for secondary sales, we will implement the first
                  ON-TRON, ON-CHAIN shared revenue program, in which all holders
                  of ninjas will receive a % of 5% from all secondary sales.

                <p>
                  At Perfect Systems, our focus isn’t just Hidden Warriors. It
                  is the TRON community at large as we won’t stay hidden much
                  longer. Through the initial sale and ninja stakeholder
                  recruitment, we will form a DAO to automate decision making
                  and help to facilitate TRON transactions, very much similar to
                  a TRON super representative. Our DAO will seed future
                  activations and ensure that funding remains adequate as the
                  project evolves across the blockchain. Our DAO will fund
                  future IRL meet-ups, community festivities and roadmap
                  activations. The Hidden Warrior DAO aims to provide a DeFI
                  liquidity pool to automate returns for capital providers and
                  key stakeholders.
